# BITAGENTS

BITAGENTS is an AI Agent Marketplace powered by a decentralized compute marketplace.

The MVP proves the full loop on Solana devnet:

1. A compute provider registers available compute.
2. A user requests an AI agent task.
3. The user pays the task fee in devnet SOL to a treasury wallet.
4. The backend assigns the paid task to an online provider.
5. A provider worker polls, claims, and runs real local computation.
6. The result is returned to the user interface.
7. A provider payout transaction is recorded and shown on Solana Explorer.

## Monorepo

```text
/apps/web              Next.js app, API routes, wallet UI, demo pages
/apps/provider-worker  Node worker that runs provider computation
/packages/shared       Shared task/provider/result types and helpers
.env.example           Environment template
DEMO.md                Exact hackathon demo script
```

## Agent task types

### Wallet Watcher Agent

Input: Solana wallet address.

The worker uses Solana devnet RPC to fetch:

- SOL balance
- SPL token account count
- latest 5 signatures
- a concise computed summary

### Research Agent

Input: keyword or project name.

The worker runs deterministic local text analysis:

- word count
- unique term count
- sentiment score from local term sets
- SHA-256 keyword hash
- structured summary, risks, and next questions

### Compute Benchmark Agent

Input: matrix size from 12 to 220.

The worker runs real CPU work:

- deterministic matrix multiplication
- runtime measurement
- checksum
- SHA-256 result hash

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

## Environment

Copy the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Set at least these values:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_TREASURY_PUBLIC_KEY=YOUR_DEVNET_TREASURY_PUBLIC_KEY
PROVIDER_WALLET=YOUR_REGISTERED_PROVIDER_PUBLIC_KEY
```

`NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL` and `SOLANA_RPC_URL` default to `https://api.devnet.solana.com`.

## Create and fund devnet wallets

Install the Solana CLI if you do not already have it, then create a treasury keypair:

```bash
solana-keygen new --outfile treasury.json
solana-keygen pubkey treasury.json
solana airdrop 2 YOUR_TREASURY_PUBLIC_KEY --url devnet
```

You can also use Phantom:

1. Open Phantom settings.
2. Enable developer settings.
3. Switch network to Devnet.
4. Copy the wallet address into the app or `.env.local`.
5. Fund it with a devnet faucet or the Solana CLI.

## Run the MVP

Run the web app and worker together:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or run them separately:

```bash
npm run dev:web
npm run dev:worker
```

The web app runs at:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

The API is served by the same Next.js app through `/api/*` routes.

## Register a provider

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/provider`.
2. Connect Phantom on devnet or paste a provider wallet address.
3. Enter provider name, compute type, price per task, and status `online`.
4. Save the provider.
5. Put the same wallet address into `.env.local` as `PROVIDER_WALLET`.
6. Start or restart the provider worker.

## Create a task

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`.
2. Connect Phantom on devnet.
3. Select Wallet Watcher, Research, or Benchmark.
4. Fill the input.
5. Click `Create and pay task`.
6. Approve the devnet SOL transfer to the treasury wallet.
7. The API records the payment signature and assigns the task to an online provider.

## Complete the task through the worker

The worker polls:

```text
GET /api/worker/tasks?providerWallet=...
```

When it finds an assigned task it calls:

```text
POST /api/tasks/:taskId/claim
POST /api/tasks/:taskId/result
```

The UI polls the API, so the task should move from `assigned` to `computing` to `completed` automatically.

## Provider payout

Go to `http://localhost:3000/demo` after a task is completed.

For the browser payout flow:

1. Connect the treasury/admin wallet in Phantom.
2. Click `Pay provider` on a completed task.
3. Approve the devnet SOL transfer to the provider wallet.
4. The payout signature is stored and linked to Solana Explorer.

Optional API payout:

Set `TREASURY_SECRET_KEY` in `.env.local` to a devnet keypair secret. The API route `/api/tasks/:taskId/payout` can then send payout when called with `{ "serverPayout": true }`.

## View Solana devnet transactions

The UI links payment and payout signatures to Solana Explorer with `?cluster=devnet`.

Manual format:

```text
https://explorer.solana.com/tx/YOUR_SIGNATURE?cluster=devnet
```

## Local data

The MVP stores providers and tasks in:

```text
.data/bitagents.json
```

Set `BITAGENTS_DATA_DIR` to use another local directory.

## Hackathon demo script

See [DEMO.md](./DEMO.md) for a live walkthrough.

## Build and checks

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

## Notes

- The MVP uses SOL on Solana devnet for hackathon simplicity.
- The code is structured so a future Anchor escrow program can replace direct Web3.js transfers.
- Core computation is not faked: wallet data comes from devnet RPC, research is deterministic local analysis, and benchmark tasks run CPU work.
